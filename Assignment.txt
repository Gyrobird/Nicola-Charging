# explainination
As per my understanding the above code is a configuration file with updates of an esphome device that is installed on an offsite location and is being used 
for charging the battery pack that consist of 24 cells in series and 8 cells in parallel. the battery pack is being charged and monitor with regards to the limits set on th git hub repository. 
further after the update a test sensor is neing depolyed that will check for the errors and the operation mode of the battery pack. the battery type is being checked and the password is being entered. here i cant understand the pourpose of the password being logged in the sensor. the device type is being checked and the software version is being checked. the manufacturer is being checked and the total runtime is being checked.
